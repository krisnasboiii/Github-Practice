# 🚀 GitHub Practice Repository – Avengers Edition 🦸‍♂️🛠️

Welcome to my fun and practical **Git & GitHub practice repository**, where I’ve turned learning version control into a **superhero mission**! 💥

---

## 🎯 Objective

I created this repository to:
- Understand and practice **core Git commands**
- Learn how Git works through **hands-on version control**
- Make Git learning more **engaging** and **creative**
- Prepare for **real-world collaboration** and **technical interviews**

Instead of traditional to-do files, I decided to bring in some fun by using **Marvel superheroes** as my content. Every hero has their own commit, file, or even branch — because even the Avengers need version control! 😄

Each `.md` file contains a hero's profile, origin, and powers, acting as example content to commit and track changes.

## 🛠️ Git Skills Practiced

In this repo, I practiced:

- `git init` – to start the repository
- `git add`, `git commit` – for tracking changes
- `git log`, `git status` – to monitor history
- **Branching & Merging** – to simulate collaborative work
- **Git stash** – to save temporary work
- **Conflict resolution** – during merging
- **Reset, revert, and rebase** – to undo and clean history
- **Markdown writing** – to make beautiful READMEs

## 💡 Why Avengers?

Because learning should be fun!

Instead of boring files, I used Marvel heroes:
- To make commits more **memorable**
- To create **branching scenarios** (like Hulk and Banner having conflicts 😆)
- To stay **motivated** while learning something new

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

Through this project, I learned:
- How Git tracks every change
- How to handle multiple contributors using branches
- How to resolve merge conflicts
- How to use GitHub for collaboration
- How to document code effectively using `README.md`
